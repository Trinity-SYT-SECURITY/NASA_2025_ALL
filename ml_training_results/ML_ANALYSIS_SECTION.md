### 🧮 Mathematical Foundations

Our ML pipeline employs several sophisticated algorithms and mathematical techniques:

#### 🌳 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Algorithm**: Gradient boosting decision trees with regularization
- **Objective Function**: Multi-class log-likelihood with L1/L2 regularization
- **Mathematical Formula**: `L(θ) = Σᵢ l(yᵢ, ŷᵢ) + Σₖ Ω(fₖ)`
- **Optimization**: Second-order Taylor approximation for faster convergence

#### 📏 Feature Scaling & Normalization
- **StandardScaler**: `z = (x - μ) / σ` where μ is mean, σ is standard deviation
- **Purpose**: Normalize features to prevent bias towards larger-scale features
- **Applied to**: All numerical features (period, radius, temperature, etc.)

#### 🎯 Similarity Matching
- **Cosine Similarity**: `sim(A,B) = (A·B) / (||A|| ||B||)`
- **Purpose**: Find most similar known planets for naming predictions
- **Threshold**: 0.3 minimum similarity for planet name matching

#### 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification correctness
- **Precision**: `TP / (TP + FP)` - Positive prediction accuracy
- **Recall**: `TP / (TP + FN)` - True positive detection rate
- **F1-Score**: `2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve
